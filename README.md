# [Python mini project] Random Password Generator
 Random Password Generator

This is a python mini project for me for learning purposes. The idea and the source code came from the internet. Little changes have been made for some purposes, and I will not declare the originality of this project.

# Usage
To input the length of the desire password.

```
passwordlength = int(input("Enter the length of password: "))
```

Then it returns a password, that created from capital letters, small letters, numbers, and symbols, and each character is joined without repeat.

```
Enter the length of password: 12
